# The Heirloom Project

This fork of [eunuchs/heirloom-project](https://github.com/eunuchs/heirloom-project) adds some fixes for building on a modern Linux, although some components, notaby most of the devtools, are still broken. You probably want to export the $SHELL to avoid most of the edits I've made for my convenience, but you definitely want to compile `heirloom-sh` before attempting any of the devtools or pkgtools. See TODO for details.

## Old Readme

This is a mirror of [The Heirloom Project](http://heirloom.sourceforge.net) CVS repositories —
a collection of hisorical UNIX tools,  
principally derived from System V, which have been patched to build on a modern system.

Particularly noteworthy are its historical Bourne shell, toolchain, and source code management tools —  
it includes some of the original implementations of m4, lex, yacc, SCCS, troff, etc.  

Also included here are the related original [vi](http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net)  and [nail](http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/mailx.html) (mailx) repositories.
